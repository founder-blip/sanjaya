<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to create a new website from scratch, taking  as a reference. The initial goal was a simple clone, but it quickly evolved into a series of iterative redesigns based on user feedback and uploaded reference materials (PDFs, posters, logos).

The core product is **Sanjaya**, a daily emotional support program for children.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- A calm, trustworthy, parent-focused website that clearly explains what Sanjaya is.
- Specific sections on the homepage: Hero, Problem Statement, Solution, Trust & Safety, How It Works, Founder section, and Pricing.
- Integration of an AI-powered chat widget.
- Creation of additional pages like About, How It Works, and FAQ.
- A secure admin dashboard for managing website content.
- The website must be mobile-responsive.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack web application has been developed with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- The frontend features a dynamic, multi-section homepage that fetches its content from the backend API.
- An AI chat widget powered by GPT-4o-mini is integrated and functional.
- A secure, password-protected admin dashboard is available at the  route. This dashboard allows for the editing of homepage content (Hero, Founder, What is Sanjaya, Contact info).
- The admin dashboard features a side-by-side layout for live previewing of content changes.
- The main homepage and navigation have been made mobile-responsive.
- The backend serves the website content, handles admin authentication (JWT), and powers the AI chat.
- The MongoDB database has been seeded with the initial content for the homepage.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was working on two user requests simultaneously:
    1. Implementing a side-by-side live preview panel within the admin dashboard to allow the user to see changes before saving.
    2. Making the main website's homepage and navigation fully mobile-responsive.
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- Agent Testing Done: Y (Used screenshot tool for both desktop admin view and simulated mobile view)
- Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by curl
- User Testing Done: N

  Issue 1:  (P0) Verify Admin Dashboard and Mobile Responsiveness
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has implemented the features and verified them using screenshots.
     - Next debug checklist: The user needs to access the admin dashboard, test editing content, and confirm the live preview works as expected. The user should also view the main website on a mobile device or a resized browser window to verify the mobile layout.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is not a bug fix, but a verification step to confirm the newly implemented features meet the user's requirements before proceeding.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- P1: Review and potentially integrate or remove orphaned pages. Several pages like , , , , and  exist in the codebase but are not currently linked in the navigation or accessible from the main app. A decision needs to be made on whether to update and integrate them or remove them.

Future Tasks:
- P2: Implement the future automation systems mentioned by the user: calling system, call scheduling system, Onboarding system, Session metadata automation, Trend generation system etc.

- : The entry point for the backend, wires together all the API routers.
- : Defines all frontend routes, including the admin paths.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  directory contains several unused or orphaned page components from previous design iterations (, , , , ). These should be either integrated into the current navigation or removed to clean up the codebase.

**key api endpoints**
- **Public:**
  - : Fetches public content for the main website.
  - : Handles messages for the AI chatbot.
- **Admin (Protected):**
  - : Admin login, returns a JWT.
  - : Fetches content for editing in the admin dashboard.
  - : Updates website content.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Admin Credentials**: Default credentials for the admin dashboard are , .
